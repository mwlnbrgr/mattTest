          <h3>About me</h3>
        </div>
          <p>I am a recent graduate of the Coder Camps .Net Program. I moved to Arizona 3 years
            ago to be closer to family, and also to escape the cold winters of the north. In my
            personal time I love to travel and play as much golf as possible!
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>My Background</h3>
          </div>
          <p>I spent a good number of years working for the Colorado State Government, followed
            a few years as a small business owner but I never felt inspired by what I was
            doing. This all made me desire a great change in my life.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Why did I decide to learn programming?</h3>
          </div>
          <p>I deceided to get into Web Developmet because I have always had a passion for
            technology and graphic design, and I wanted a career where I can use that passion
            to do something exciting. Web Developement to me is all togather very excitng and
            challenging and I love it!
          </P>
