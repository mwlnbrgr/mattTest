        <p>
            This is just a quick introduction page to show you some of my skills
            and a few of the projects that I have worked on. I am very proud of the
            work I have done here, and the things I was able to accomplish in a relatively
            short amount of time!

            <h3>2.) "Lister"</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
        Developed by myself and my Codercamps classmates Joe Waynick and Suzanne
        Federico. Using the "Agile Methodology", we worked as a small Dev Team and
        created this very powerful business tool! Lister is a web app that can be
        used by any online entrepreneur who wishes to leverage the power of Amazon
        to sell products. Lister interfces with Amazon's complex API and makes it
        much faster and easier to upload and list your products for sale. This app
        will save you many hours weekly, and free up your time to do all of the other
        important business processes you might have on your agenda.

        <p>
            This is my first published Website! I spent about 6 weeks developing this Full-Stack
            Website. As a Coder Camps student it was required that I complete this individual
            project in class. I decided to choose the specific subject matter based upon something
            that meant something to me personally. As an indepandant business person prior to
            attending Coder Camps I was Co-Owner of this business, and I always thought it needed
            a better web presence than a simple Wordpress page.
